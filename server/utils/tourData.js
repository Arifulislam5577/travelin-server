      "Travelling Essay To travel from one place to another for different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides this, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays in one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. It also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveller can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of another country. I like travelling very much.",

      "Man is a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a place for a long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever they find time and opportunity. People travel for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also travel for business and employment. Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we go to a new place all of our senses and instincts (বােধশক্তি) become awake (জাগ্রত). In such circumstances, we can learn new things very easily. Everything seems beautiful and sterling in a new place. With new scientific inventions, the ways and means of traveling have changed dramatically. Now different types of vehicles are available to us. They include bus, truck, train, minibus, lorry, microbus, maxi, airplane, helicopter, spacecraft, submarine, launch, steamer, hovercraft etc. By these vehicles, we can cover a long distance within a short time. So, we should try to travel more and more.",

      "Travelling has manifold benefits. It is a part and parcel of our education. Our education and bookish knowledge remain imperfect without traveling. We may read about many places in our history books. If we can visit these places, the study of history becomes interesting. We read about men and things from different parts of the world. By traveling to different parts of the world, we see new people and new things. We can learn much about the manners and customs of those people. In this way, we can gain much knowledge. Consequently, our narrowness of mind disappears. Many people travel to different places to improve their health. If they go to a healthy place, they can recover their lost health. Travelling is also a source of joy to us. We see new objects and beautiful natural scenery. This refreshes both our mind and body.",
